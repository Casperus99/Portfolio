# Decision Tree Classifier

In the project below, I investigate the effectiveness of the decision tree algorithm and its modifications on an obesity dataset. The model is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library.

Created: 11/2022

## Dataset
Dataset presents estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. The data contains 2111 records, 77% of which are generated synthetically using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, 23% of the data was collected directly from users through a web platform.

Source along with an article describing this dataset can be found [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919306985?via%3Dihub#fd1)

### Features
The data contains 16 features. A few of them are: height, weight, gender, and family history with overweight.  
Their division by type is as follows:

- Numerical: 8
- Categorical: 8
  - Nominal: 6
  - Ordinal: 2
  
### Target attribute
To label the data the BMI for each individual had to be calculated with equation (1). The results were then compared with the data provided by WHO and the Mexican Normativity.

The records are labeled with the class variable NObesity (Obesity Level), that allows classification of the data using the values of Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III depending on the calculated BMI value. 


## Data Preprocessing

### Fixing synthetic labels

Many records are created synthetically and so their classes. This means that some of these classes could be incorrect taking into account strict formula used for labelling. Therefore it is needed to recalculate them based on both weight and height of given record. To perform this simple formula in Excel was created.

### Missing and imbalanced data

These issues has been already resolved by the authors. There are no missing values, and data is distribiuted rather equally (Fig. 1.) thanks to synthetic data.

### Dealing with categorical data

Since categorical features are present and decision tree implementation used does not handle that type of data they need to be encoded. To solve this issue scikit-learn ```OneHotEncoder``` and ```OrdinalEncoder``` classes were used. Unfortunately without AI or advanced dictionaries it is hard to automate separating ordinal from nominal data. Therefore it is required to manually provide names of all ordinal features and their possible categories in correct order. Then remaining categorical data is treated as nominal i.e. encoded with one-hot encoding.

## Classification

### Basic implementation

After preprocessing the following steps are performed to obtain efficiency of the given model:  

1. Split feature columns from target columns
2. Divide the data into training and testing sets according to k-cross validation rules
3. Train the tree using training set
4. Generate predictions for testing records
5. Compare predictions with expected values (calculate accuracy)
6. Perform points 2-5 *k* times
7. Calculate mean accuracy and standard devation

Additionaly, Working with relatively small datasets like this one may lead to quite different results in the next runs. Therefore, these steps are repeated *n* times to generate more accuracy values thus more stable outcome.  

Running program with *k* = 10 and *n* = 10 (100 trees) provided:  
**Mean accuracy** = 0.914  
**Standard deviation** = 0.018

### Optimizing max depth parameter

One way to optimize a decision tree is to limit its maximum depth. The impact of this action on the accuracy of the model is presented in the bar plot below.

<p align="center">

</p>

As expected, the accuracy at the high maximum depth is high and decreases with decreasing depth. The reason for this is resignation from subsequent nodes that make important divisions. Stable model results above the maximum depth of 9 mean that deeper models either do not exist or do not perform better. Therefore, this coefficient should remain at this value.

## Reducing features

Once one have found the settings of hyperparameters that generate a satisfactory model, it is worth answering the question whether all attributes are needed. After all, the final decision tree may not use certain attributes at all, or omitting them would reduce the estimator's effectiveness only slightly. One way to find insignificant attributes is **backward selection**. Starting from the full model (with all attributes), we check which attribute removal would decrease the quality the least, remove it from the current model and start the next iteration. The result of such a selection is presented in the table below.

| Attribute removed <br> in specific iteration | Age    | FAF    | TUE    | MTRANS | Gender | ... | CALC   | NCP    | SCC   | SMOKE  | Height  |
|----------------------------------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|-----|--------|--------|-------|--------|---------|
| Accuracy [%]                                 | 91.98  | 92.38  | 92.53  | 93.03  | 93.30  | ... | 94.82  | 94.80  | 94.94 | 94.95  | 62.77   |
| Std deviation                                | 1.943  | 1.939  | 1.779  | 1.879  | 1.683  | ... | 1.613  | 1.383  | 1.497 | 1.579  | 2.770   |
| Size [nodes]                                 | 291.06 | 291.84 | 291.16 | 287.34 | 288.08 | ... | 251.12 | 248.92 | 245.9 | 245.84 | 1139.42 |

*Weight* was the last feature that remained.   
As you can see, the average accuracy of the models increases until the *Height* attribute is removed. Interestingly, this occurs despite the shrinkage of trees, which would suggest that these trees should be "dumber". The explanation for this phenomenon is most likely the **overfitting** of the original model. Without further features, the models are unable to find more detailed differences, so they do not generate further nodes. However, it seems that these detailed differences would only lead to overfitted models anyway. In that case, *Height* and *Weight* are enough to achieve the best model. It appears that these trees are unable to perceive any additional information from the other attributes.

It is worth to note that model without these two features achieves:  
**Mean accuracy** = 0.715    
**Standard deviation** = 0.030  
**Mean size** = 926.54
