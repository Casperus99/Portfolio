# KACPER NOWAKOWSKI - PORTFOLIO
This is database presenting my projects (smaller and bigger) and my preparation resources for certifications.


## [Certificates](<./Certificates>)
Materials that I gathered and prepared as part of my preparation to certification exams. (Python and Apache Spark)

## [Others](<./Others>)
Place for uncategorized materials. Currently there is only small Python Notebook about counterfactuals (quite interesting nonetheless!).
