## Project Context Overview ##
Hello Gemini,

You are being provided with a comprehensive overview of a Python project. This context is crucial for any subsequent tasks or questions I might pose regarding the codebase, architecture, or documentation.

Please review the following sections thoroughly:
1.  **Project Directory Structure:** A visual representation of the project's file and folder hierarchy.
2.  **Source Code Section:** The complete source code of all Python files found within the project, each clearly labeled with its relative path.
3.  **Additional Documentation:** A project documentation file (e.g., README.md) has been provided separately for your reference.

I will follow up with specific questions or tasks after you have assimilated this foundational information.
