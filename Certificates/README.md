# CERTIFICATES

Python is my main (programing) language.

### [Associate Programmer](</Python Associate (PCAP)>)
You can read about this certification [here](https://pythoninstitute.org/pcap).

### [Entry-Level Programmer](</Python Entry-Level (PCEP)>)

## Apache Spark

### [Databricks Certified Associate Developer for Apache Spark (PySpark)](</Apache Spark (PySpark, DataBricks)>)

I haven't finally done this one, because when I was ready for the exam I realised that the syllabus had changed... week before.
But materials (and knowledge) are valid nonetheless.
